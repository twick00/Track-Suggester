# Infinitely Scalable Form
This is a language suggester for web-development.
### The goal was to be able enter as much data as you want in json-like format and it would scale with the content.
I did not take into account performance so don't add too much to it or you might break your chrome client.

Infinitely Scalable Form
Instructions: Its broken right now but the scaling form actually does work. I just had trouble showing results.
Not sure what I should put for copyright/license info.
